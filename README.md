The Geolocation API provides a straightforward way to access geographical location data associated with a user’s device. Whether it’s determined through GPS, Wi-Fi, or IP geolocation, this API allows you to retrieve information like latitude, longitude, altitude, and speed. It’s particularly useful for applications that need location-based features, such as showing a user’s position on a map, providing local information, or enabling turn-by-turn navigation.
